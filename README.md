# Rand-ESU Algorithm Adaptation for Binary-Weighted Networks

### Description:
This project focuses on adapting and evaluating the Rand-ESU algorithm to work with binary-weighted networks. The primary objectives include implementing modifications to the Rand-ESU algorithm for binary-weighted networks, evaluating its performance on multiple datasets, and visualizing the detected subgraphs and sampling speed. Offering a new way to detect more significant subgraphs in binary weighted networks.

### The network datasets are:
*Bitcoin Alpha Trust Network:* Bitcoin Alpha trust network data in a directed graph with weights.

*Host Pathogen Interactions:* Protein-protein interaction networks.
(https://figshare.com/articles/dataset/SpeciesInteractions_EID2/1381853?file=2196534) (Maya Wardeh, Claire Risley, Marie McIntyre, Christian Setzkorn, Matthew Baylis)

*Colombian City Inter-Zone Mobility:* Traffic flow between zones in a city.

### Key Features: 
Modified Rand-ESU Algorithm: The Rand-ESU algorithm was modified to handle binary-weighted networks, where edges with weights â‰¥ threshold are converted to 1, and others are 0.
Dataset Evaluation: Comprehensive evaluation of subgraph sampling speed for multiple datasets and subgraph sizes.
Visualization: Visual representation of detected subgraphs(for comparing the subgraph sampling significance) and comparative sampling speed plots for Initial Rand-ESU and Modified Rand-ESU.

### Modules and Files: 
initial_rand_esu_eval.py: Evaluation of the initial Rand-ESU algorithm.
weighted_rand_esu_eval.py: Evaluation of the modified Rand-ESU algorithm with binary-weighted networks.
combined_plot.py: Combines and visualizes the sampling speed results for different datasets and algorithms.
run.py: Runs all evaluation and plotting scripts sequentially.
