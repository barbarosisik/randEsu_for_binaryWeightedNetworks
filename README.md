# randEsu_for_binaryWeightedNetworks
This project focuses on adapting and evaluating the Rand-ESU algorithm to work with binary-weighted networks. The primary objectives include implementing modifications to the Rand-ESU algorithm for binary-weighted networks, evaluating its performance on multiple datasets, and visualizing the detected subgraphs and sampling speed.
